# 🐍 Snake Game

A modern and interactive Snake Game built in Python using the turtle graphics library.
The project offers smooth animations, dynamic gameplay, score tracking, and persistent high-score saving — all designed for an engaging user experience.

## 🎮 Features

- **🧩 Object-Oriented Design** — Modular structure with separate classes for Snake, Food, and ScoreBoard.
- **🍎 Dynamic Food Spawning** — Food appears randomly and avoids overlapping with the snake’s body.
- **🧠 Smart Collision Detection** — Detects collisions with walls and the snake’s own tail.
- **💾 Persistent High Score** — Automatically saves and loads high scores from a local file (data.txt).
- **⏯️ Restart or Quit Option** — Easily restart the game with R or quit with Q after a game over.
- **⚡ Smooth Animations** — Uses screen.tracer(0) and timed updates for fluid motion.

## 🕹️ How to Play

1. Run the game using:
    - python main.py

2. Use the arrow keys ⬆️ ⬇️ ⬅️ ➡️ to control your snake.
3. Eat the red food to grow and increase your score.
4. Avoid hitting the walls or your own tail!
5. When the game ends:
    - Press R to restart.
    - Press Q to quit.
